## A-meta-analysis-reveals-edge-effects-within-marine-protected-areas

# This R code is analyzing the spatial patterns of marine population across no-take MPAs boundaries based on empirical data extracted from published papers.
# The aim of this analysis is to describe the dominant spatial pattern of marine populations across MPA borders and to explore potential drivers of these patterns using GAMs (General Additive Models).
